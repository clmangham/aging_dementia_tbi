    "## AD ML binary classification\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms were used to identify the discriminative power of the top ten differentially expressed genes in distinguishing between the two categories. Support vector machines using both linear and radial basis function kernels were selected for the binary classification in addition to random forest and quadratic Bayes algorithms [36]. The data was divided into a training set and a test set. The training set consisted of approximately 70% of the samples (114 samples) and the remaining 30% were used for testing to test and approximate how the classifiers generalize to unknown data. There was no overlap in the subjects and samples between the training and testing data to avoid any correlation between samples in both sets. The genes were used as features for each sample with all different combinations of N genes (2 ≤ N ≤ 10) out of 10 genes. For every combination of N genes, the combination with the maximum accuracy on the training data was chosen and the corresponding accuracy on the test data was reported on those N genes to avoid data snooping. Precision and recall scores in addition to the F1 score were reported for the testing accuracy that corresponded to the maximum training accuracy over all combinations.\"\n",
