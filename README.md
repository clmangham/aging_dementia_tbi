## SIADS Capstone Project - Dementia Biomarker Analysis and ML

Project Team: The Neuromancers

### Project Statement
Our goal with this project is to further the understanding of dementia by analyzing various biomarkers to derive insights about the various underlying diseases.  We attempt to build on previous studies examining the genetic factors associated with Dementia/Alzheimerâ€™s Disease.

### Dataset: Aging, Dementia and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Study
The dataset we will be using for this project was developed by the Allen Institute for Brain Science in consortium with the University of Washington and Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute.  These organizations undertook a longitudinal cohort-based study known as the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study.  To enroll in the study, participants could not have an existing dementia diagnosis or reside in a nursing home.

The data used in our analysis comes from a sample within this broader study.  This particular group of participants had either experienced at least one traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness or were part of the similarity-matched control group.
